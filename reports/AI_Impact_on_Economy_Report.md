## **Introduction**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the world in ways we never imagined. From how we work to how businesses operate, AI is driving big changes in the economy. It is boosting productivity, creating new industries, and even changing the jobs we do. But it also brings challenges like job losses, inequality, and ethical concerns. This report breaks down how AI is impacting the economy in simple words, with facts and numbers to back it up.

## **1. How AI is Changing Jobs**

### **Jobs at Risk**
AI and automation are taking over **repetitive and rule-based jobs**. For example:
- **Manufacturing**: Robots are doing tasks like assembly and packaging.
- **Customer Service**: Chatbots and virtual assistants are handling customer queries.
- **Data Entry**: AI tools are processing information faster than humans.

A **2023 McKinsey report** found that **30% of hours worked in the U.S. economy** could be automated by **2030**. That means many jobs, especially in manufacturing, retail, and administration, are at risk.

### **Jobs That Are Safe (For Now)**
Not all jobs are at risk. Roles that require **creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving** are safer. These include:
- **Healthcare**: Doctors, nurses, and caregivers.
- **Education**: Teachers and trainers.
- **Creative Fields**: Artists, writers, and designers.

### **Who is Most Affected?**
- **Women**: They face a **25% higher risk** of losing jobs because they are more likely to work in administrative and customer service roles (UN Women, 2024).
- **Rural Areas**: AI adoption is **3–5 times higher in cities**, leaving rural workers behind (Brookings, 2024).

### **Key Numbers**

## **6. What’s Next? Policy and Future Outlook**

### **Challenges Ahead**
1. **Job Displacement Without Reskilling**: **40% of displaced workers** struggle to find new jobs because they lack the right skills (ILO, 2024).
2. **AI Bias**: AI systems can be **biased** in hiring, lending, and policing, affecting minorities (MIT, 2023).
3. **Lack of Regulation**: There’s no **global rulebook** for AI, leading to risks like **deepfakes, surveillance, and autonomous weapons** (EU AI Act, 2024).
4. **Big Tech Monopolies**: A few companies like **Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba** control **70% of AI patents**, making it hard for smaller businesses to compete (WIPO, 2023).

### **What the Future Holds**
- **By 2026**:
  - **90% of enterprise software** will use AI (Gartner, 2023).
  - **50% of customer service interactions** will be handled by AI (Juniper Research, 2024).
  - AI could **displace 85 million jobs but create 97 million new ones** (WEF, 2023).

- **Long-Term (2030 and Beyond)**:
  - **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: AI that can perform **any intellectual task** like a human could redefine work and creativity (DeepMind, 2024).
  - **Post-Scarcity Economics**: If AI automates most jobs, we might see a future where **basic needs are met without traditional work** (OpenAI, 2023).

### **What Can Be Done?**
To make sure AI benefits everyone, governments and businesses should:
1. **Invest in Education and Reskilling**: Programs like **Germany’s AI training initiatives** can help workers adapt.
2. **Implement Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Countries like **Alaska** already provide a basic income to citizens. This could help workers displaced by AI.
3. **Regulate AI**: Laws like the **EU AI Act** and the **U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act** can prevent misuse and bias.
4. **Support Developing Nations**: Initiatives like the **UN’s AI for Good** can help poorer countries adopt AI.
